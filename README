Method-Slice
============

Perl has a very convenient feature called I<slice>, to extract
several pieces of information at once from an array or from a hash
(see L<perldata/"Slices"). It is even possible to assign a list,
to a slice, i.e. to simultaneously update several items within
an array or hash.

Unfortunately, when it comes to objects with accessor methods,
good practice forbids us to directly access the internal
hash or array that stores the object state; so slices are no
longer available, and every attribute of the object must be accessed
in a separate call.

The present module comes the rescue : it exports a single subroutine
C<mslice> (for "method slice"), that takes an object and a collection
of method names, and encapsulates a list of method calls, either to get
a list of attributes, or to set them in a single list operation.
